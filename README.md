# 📚 ScholarAI: Predicting Citation Impact from Research Abstracts using NLP & Statistical Modeling

**Can we predict how often a research paper will be cited — using just its title, abstract, and metadata?**

**ScholarAI** is an academic machine learning project that explores this question using NLP, explainable AI, and gradient boosting. Built by a Master’s student in Statistics & Data Analytics, it aims to model what makes scientific work *citable*.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To predict the **future citation count** of a paper using:

- 📝 Title
- 📄 Abstract
- 🔍 Metadata (year, authors, journal, venue, etc.)

And explore:

> **What makes some papers more cited than others?**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- spaCy, BERT (Transformers)
- SHAP (for interpretability)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit (for interactive UI)

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/AfsarJahan/scholarai.git
cd scholarai

# 2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # on Windows
source venv/bin/activate   # on macOS/Linux

## 📈 Demo Coming Soon

An interactive web app will let you input a paper's title and abstract — and get a predicted citation count, plus SHAP visualizations for interpretability.
